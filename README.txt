Stephanie Colunga: I created the ER model for our budgeting application and identified the functional dependencies needed to normalize the schema to BCNF. These results helped me ensure that each entity (Users, Categories, Transactions, and Budgets) was modeled efficiently with proper keys and relationships. On the backend, I implemented the homepage dashboard and its corresponding Mustache template and CSS styling to display the user's monthly income, expenses, net balance, and recent transactions. I also developed the TransactionService class, which handles SQL queries, retrieves dashboard data, maps query results into Transaction model objects, and provides methods for transaction retrieval and summaries.

My Phuong Ly: I created the database schema & implemented the categories part. This feature allows users to create, view, and delete income and expense categories that are securely associated with their accounts. Categories are linked to transactions through foreign keys to ensure accurate financial tracking and reporting.
