        Approach used for securely storing user passwords
    --------------------------------------------------------

    In this project, we used a similar approach to Project 2, for storing user passwords.
    Some of the practices we used are: 

    1. Password Hashing 
        - When a user registers a new account, their password is not stored in the database as plain text. 
        - Passwords are hashed before they are saved into the database
        - BCrypt is used to securely hash the user password into the database by 

    2. BCrypt 
        - When a user registers an account, the raw password is passed through BCrypt 
        - BCrypt will then generate a unique 16 bit salt, combined the plain text password
        - The data will then be ran throught the BCrypt algorithm for a specific number of rounds, and the final hash 
        is stored into the database
        - So, when a user tries to log into their account, BCrypt will take the password entered by the user, extract the 
        salt and cost factor of the stored password, and then re-hash the user input
        - Then, the new hash is compared to the hashed password stored in the database, and if they are a match, the user 
        is successfully logged in, otherwise the log in will fail.
